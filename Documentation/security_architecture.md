&nbsp; Security Architecture



The network uses a layered defense strategy:



&nbsp;Security Layers



1\. VLAN Segmentation

2\. Access Control Lists (ACL)

3\. Firewall Filtering

4\. Port Security

5\. DHCP Snooping

6\. Dynamic ARP Inspection

7\. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

8\. Autonomous Response Mechanism



&nbsp;Autonomous Response Actions



When a threat is detected:



\- Attacker IP blocked using ACL

\- Device moved to quarantine VLAN

\- Switch port shutdown

\- Alert generated to SOC
